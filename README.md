# RGPD Contract
As a European-based company, Varanida is GDPR compliant by design, and by philosophy. We believe blockchain technologies are a great addition to GDPR, with the goal of creating more trust between advertisers, publishers, and users. To help improve the use of blockchain for GDPR compliance, we are proposing an Ethereum Smart Contract that can be used to track opt-in and opt-out requests in a seamless and transparent way. This provides developers with a way to build up a fully trusted environment for personal data protection, and also allows advertisers and publishers to demonstrate their commitment to proper use of customer data.
